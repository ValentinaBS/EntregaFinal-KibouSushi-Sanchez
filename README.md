## Overview

### The task

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Log in, browse the products and go to their details.
- See the description, photo and price and put it into the cart from the product detail page.
- Display a compact listing of the order with the total price, once the cart has at least one product.
- Activate the 'checkout' button when they enter their first name, last name, telephone number and e-mail (entering it twice to check that it is correct).
- Click 'submit order' to save in the database an order with all the products, the date and give feedback on the order number.
